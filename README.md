# {A Python Project: Predicting the Results of a Football Game.}

#### {IP WEEK 6 DATA SCIENCE CORE}, {September, 2019}

#### By **{Josephine Wanjiku}**

## Description

* In this project I will be acting as a football analyst in Mchezopesa Ltd company to :

* Predict the result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (including rank of the respective team).


## Experimental Design

1.1.4 Experimental design taken
Perform your EDA

- Perform any necessary feature engineering

- Check of multicollinearity

- Building a model

- Approach 1: Polynomial regression model

      * Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores
      * Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores
   
- Approach 2: Logistic regression model

        - Figure out from the home team’s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)
   
- Approach 3: Ridge, Lasso, & Elastic Net Regression models

        * Predict the rank of the teams and compare the models.

- Cross-validate the model

- Compute RMSE

- Create residual plots for the model

- Assess Heteroscedasticity using Bartlett’s test

- Challenge the solution.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Google colab/jupyter notebook
* Python basics
* Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit learn)
* Github
